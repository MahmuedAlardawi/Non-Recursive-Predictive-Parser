# Non-Recursive-Predictive-Parser
King AbdulAziz Universality - Compiler Construction (CPCS-302)

## Project Overview

This project is part of a group assignment for the CPCS-302 Compiler Construction course. The objective is to create a non-recursive predictive parser with error recovery for infix expressions, as described by a given context-free grammar (CFG).

## Features

- Parsing infix expressions using a manually constructed parse table.
- Error recovery to handle and report syntax errors.
- Output left-most derivations of expressions.

## Installation

No installation is needed. Ensure you have Java installed to compile and run the program.

## Usage

1. Place your test expressions in `input.txt`.
2. Compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac PredictiveParser.java
